## 🚩 Challenge 5: Minimum Viable Exchange


The dex contract was developed from scratch taking as a reference the Uniswap v1 whitepaper: https://github.com/runtimeverification/verified-smart-contracts/blob/uniswap/uniswap/x-y-k.pdf

The unit test is developed based on the whitepaper and the reconciliation of some values extracted from a already developed solution in excel.
